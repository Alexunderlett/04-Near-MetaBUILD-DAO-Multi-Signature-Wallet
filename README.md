## 7.What is the RainbowCity Foundation？


RainbowCity Foundation is a non-profit foundation initiated and founded by Mr. RainbowKun. Headquartered in Singapore, Asia, it mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Mr. RainbowKun himself is a loyal fan of Bitcoin and a believer of Satoshi Nakamoto, dedicated to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized ideas. He once put forward the concept of "Bit Civilization" for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto , hoping to promote the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practice the true Bitcoin spirit.


Mr. Rainbow Kun believes that in the crypto world, human civilization will have an unprecedented super economy in the future. It is constructed in the form of a decentralized protocol, which puts different and decentralized economic behaviors into a unified economy, and truly becomes the infrastructure of future human civilization in the future. The Rainbow city Foundation was established under this background.

The RainbowCity Foundation plans to invest in 7 major areas in the next ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. Strive to become a super economy with a market value of one trillion US dollars. The RainbowDAO Protocol is the first project launched by the Rainbowcity Foundation to build the infrastructure of the DAO ecosystem and contribute our wisdom and strength to the development of the global DAO career.

##  Project Story

### 1.Inspiration

The DAO multi-signature wallet management system is another important innovation in our DAO infrastructure product. The design of this product is mainly inspired by the famous multi-signature wallet gnosis-safe but our system is an upgrading based on it. Fund management is the core module of various types of DAO organizations, managing the funds of community in the form of multi-signature. However, functions of the existing multi-signature wallet system are still too simple. To counter this, we have developed the DAO multi-signature wallet management system.

### 2.What it does



Our DAO multi-signature wallet management system is an upgrading based on gnosis-safe, which has the existing functions of gnosis-safe and some unique capabilities.

This multi-signature wallet system focuses on two shortages of DAO organization:



⑴ Our wallet system can be upgraded through governance.

When the gnosis-safe multi-signature wallet system is established, all its parameters are fixed, such as the multi-signature address and control parameters, they are all set and cannot be upgraded. However, our system allows two improvements. First, the existing multi-signature signers can be changed; second, the multi-signature control parameters can be altered. For example, 3/6 control parameters can be changed to 4/9. In this way, the upgradeability of the DAO multi-signature wallet is realized.



(2) By establishing Defi controller, we can deposit the funds of multi-signature wallet into various DeFi protocols, so that the funds in the multi-signature wallet can increase in value and gain additional income. That is also a major innovation.

### 3.How we built it


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/Logic-diagram/04-Logic-diagram-of-Multi-Sign-Wallet.png)


DAO multi-signature wallet system has the following functions:

⑴ Establishment of DAO multi-signature. Anyone can establish their multi-signature wallet system among different wallet addresses, set multi-signature control parameters and approve the use of funds in the form of multi-signature;

(2) Upgrading in DAO multi-signature wallet protocol. For gnosis-safe, once the multi-signature contract is deployed, the information of the contract cannot be changed. In contrast, in our contract, signers and signing conditions of multi-signature can be changed through multi-signature review and approval. Hence, funds in DAO can be managed more flexibly;

(3) DeFi controller. Funds in the vault can be used to increase liquidity in decentralized exchanges through multi-signature to obtain benefits generated by liquidity; or, funds in the vault can be deposited and withdrawn from lending platforms to attain benefit through multi-signature. These two functions can help to activate the precipitation funds in the multi-signature wallet, so that the value of funds can be increased through various DeFi protocols to maximize the efficiency of the use of funds.

### 4.Challenges we ran into



When developing DAO multi-signature wallet system, the biggest challenge for us is how to deposit the funds of the multi-signature wallet into various DeFi protocols in the form of multi-signature review and approval, which is very difficult. We must fully refine each step of the operation, sort out specific product details and finally realize the cross-contract interaction between multi-signature wallet and DeFi protocol.

For example, if we want to deposit the funds of the multi-signature wallet into Compound's banking system. From depositing to borrowing, we have to make sure every step goes smoothly to realize the perfect interaction between multi-signature wallet system and Compound lending system and all the interaction is carried out in the form of multi-signature review and approval.

### 5.Accomplishments that we're proud of



When developing DAO multi-signature wallet, our biggest achievement is that we successfully developed DeFi controller. By making different DeFi controllers, the funds in the multi-signature wallet can interact with various DeFi protocols, so that the precipitation funds can be used effectively, which is of great benefit to DAO organization.

### 6.What we learned



Through this development, the most valuable knowledge we got is that we know how to construct cross-contract calls between different contracts and how to render funds in the wallet interact with other DeFi protocols in the form of multi-signature. We currently only developed two DeFi controllers. One can deposit multi-signature funds into decentralized exchanges to increase liquidity; the other can deposit them into lending agreements to earn interest. In the future, we will cooperate with various DeFi protocols to develop different controllers for an assortment of DeFi protocols and realize the interaction between multi-signature wallets and more DeFi protocols.


### 7.What's next for DAO-Multi-Signature-Committee 



Our work next is continue to cope with the details of this product, reconstruct the logic of the product and make this product as adaptable as possible to meet the needs of various types of DAO organizations. When the product functions are further improved, we will submit an external audit. When the audit is done, we will deploy the product to each public chain.
